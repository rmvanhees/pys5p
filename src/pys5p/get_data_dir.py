    Obtain directory with test datasets

    Limited to UNIX/Linux/MacOS operating systems

    This module checks if the following directories are available:
     - /data/$USER/pys5p-data
     - /Users/$USER/pys5p-data
     - environment variable PYS5P_DATA_DIR

    It expects the data to be organized in the sub-directories:
     - CKD which should contain the SWIR dpqf CKD
     - OCM which should contain at least one directory of an on-ground
       calibration measurement with one or more OCAL LX products.
     - L1B which should contain at least one offline calibration, irradiance
       and radiance product.
     - ICM which contain at least one inflight calibration product.
